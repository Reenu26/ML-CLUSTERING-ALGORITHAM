# ML-CLUSTERING-ALGORITHAM

IN this Work, we explore unsupervised machine learning techniques to cluster the Iris dataset using two clustering algorithms: K-Means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering. 
steps involved
loaded the Iris Dataset: We begin by loading the dataset and preprocessing it to ensure it's ready for clustering (i.e., dropping the species column, as this is an unsupervised task).
Clustering with K-Means: Apply K-Means clustering with the optimal number of clusters (K=3) and visualize the clusters using scatter plots.
Clustering with Hierarchical Clustering: Perform hierarchical clustering and plot a dendrogram to visually inspect the hierarchical relationships within the data.
Comparison and Insights: Compare the results of both clustering techniques and analyze the advantages and limitations of each method with respect to the Iris dataset.

This work helps build foundational knowledge in unsupervised learning and clustering techniques, essential for tasks like customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and pattern recognition.
